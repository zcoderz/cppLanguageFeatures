I have written here examples identifying C++ language features and STL algorithms that were introduced from C++ 11 to C++ 20.  

The Source of the material has been the below books from Nicolai Josuttis and my own experience:  

--The C++ Standard Library - A Tutorial and Reference 
http://www.cppstdlib.com/  
--C++17 - The Complete Guide 
http://www.cppstd17.com/  
--C++20 - The Complete Guide 
http://www.cppstd20.com/  
--C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide
